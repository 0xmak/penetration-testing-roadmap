# What is XSS?
XSS, short for Cross-Site Scripting, is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then execute in the browsers of those users, leading to various harmful actions.

## How Does XSS Work?
- Injection Point: Attackers find input fields on a website where they can enter data. This can be in the form of text boxes, comment sections, or URL parameters.

- Malicious Script Injection: The attacker then inserts malicious JavaScript code into these input fields. This code can be simple or complex, designed to perform specific actions.

- User Interaction: When other users interact with the affected page, the injected script executes in their browsers.

## Types of XSS:
- Stored XSS: The injected script is permanently stored on the target server. For example, in a database. Whenever a user accesses the compromised page, the script executes.

- Reflected XSS: The injected script is reflected off a web server. This means that the script is included in the URL sent to the server, which then reflects it back in the response. The attacker typically tricks a user into clicking a specially crafted link containing the malicious script.

- DOM-based XSS: The vulnerability lies within the Document Object Model (DOM) instead of the server-side code. The attacker manipulates the DOM environment to execute malicious scripts.

## Impact of XSS:
- Data Theft: Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, cookies, or personal data.

- Session Hijacking: By stealing session cookies, attackers can impersonate users and perform actions on their behalf.

- Website Defacement: Attackers can modify the content of web pages, defacing the website and damaging its reputation.

- Phishing Attacks: Malicious scripts can redirect users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.

## Mitigating XSS:
- Input Sanitization: Validate and filter user input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.

- Output Encoding: Encode user-supplied data before displaying it in web pages to prevent script execution.

- Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

- Regular Security Audits: Regularly audit web applications for vulnerabilities and apply security patches promptly.

XSS is a serious threat to web application security, but with proper understanding and preventive measures, it can be mitigated effectively.
